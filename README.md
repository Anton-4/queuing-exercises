# queuing-exercises

Solutions to the exercises for the course "Queuing Thoery and Simulation" given at Ghent University

I found that the solutions written down in class often missed steps, important details and
explanations, which is why I have created this document with detailed, annotated and complete
solutions for most exercises.

If certain solutions are unclear or new exercises are given please create issues or contribute to
the github repository so that we can maintain this document over the years.

This document was based on notes by ir. Mathias De Brouwer and ir. Anton Van Moere,
L A TEXcreated by Anton Van Moere. Help in understanding and expanding solutions was pro-
vided by ir. Alexander Erreygers and dr. Sarah Dendievel. Course was given by Professor
Dieter Fiems and Professor. ir. Joris Walraevens.
